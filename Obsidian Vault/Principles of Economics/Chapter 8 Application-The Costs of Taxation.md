title:# Case study the deadweight loss debate
Supply,demand,elasticity,deadweight loss-----all this economic theory is enough to make your head spin.But believe it or not,these ideas go to the heart of a profound political question:How big should the government be? The reason the debate hinges on these concepts is that the larger the deadweight loss of taxation,the larger the cost of any government program.If taxation entails very large deadweight losses,then these losses are a strong argument for a leaner government that does less and taxes less.By contrast, if taxes  impose only small deadweight losses, then government programs are less costly than they otherwise might be. <font color="#008000">说句实话，最后这句话我不太了解。</font> 
So how big are the deadweight losses of taxation? This is a question about which economics disagree. To see the nature of this disagreement, consider the most important tax in the U.S economy---the tax on labor. The Social Security tax, the Medicare tax, and, to a large extent, the federal income tax are labor taxes. Many state government also tax labor earnings. A labor tax places a wedge between the wage that firms pay and the wage that workers receive.If we add all forms of labor taxes together, the marginal tax rate on labor income---the tax on the last dollar of earnings---is almost 50 percent for many workers.
Although the size of the labor tax is easy to determine, the deadweight loss of this tax is less straightforward. Economists disagree about whether this 50 percent labor tax has a small or a large deadweight loss. This disagreement arises because they hold different views about the elasticity of labor supply. <font color="#008000">这里我说句实话很难把控就业的弹性，谁都想找那种工资高，竞争压力小的职业。那么这种职业的弹性怎样？对于供给方来讲（找工作的人）希望弹性小（竞争压力小），对于需求方（企业）要求弹性大（企业特别需要），而且最好是有一定底线，即企业不管工资有多少都必须要招一定数目的这个职业的人。操！不对，如果政府是企业的话，那么扫大街的人不就是这种情况吗？一个月工资从1000到500，政府肯定会多招人的，但是如果是一个程序员，工资从50000到45000，我想它就不会要招那么多人，甚至不动，这样弹性最大，好像弹性大的未必代表这个职业薪资高。</font> 
Economists who argue that labor taxes are not very distorting believe that labor supply is fairly inelastic. Most people, they claim, would work full-time regardless of the wage. If so, the labor supply curve is almost vertical, and a tax on labor has a small deadweight loss.
Economists who argue that labor taxes are highly distorting believe that labor supply is more elastic. They admit that some groups of workers may supply their labor inelastically but claim that many other groups respond more to incentives. Here are some examples:
* Many workers can adjust the number of hours they work---for instance, by working overtime. The higher the wage, the more hours they choose to work.

* Some families have second earners---often married women with children---with some direction over whether to do unpaid work at home or paid work in the marketplace. When deciding whether to take a job, these second earners compare the benefits of being at home(including savings on the cost of child care) with the wages they could earn.
* Many of the elderly can choose when to retire, and their decisions are partly based on the wage. Once they are retired, the wage determines their incentive to work part-time.
* Some people consider engaging in illegal economic activity, such as the drug trade, or working at jobs that pay "under the table" to evade taxes. Economists call this *underground economy*. In deciding whether to work in the underground economy or at a legitimate job, these potential criminals compare what they can earn by breaking the law with the wage they can earn legally. 

In each of  these cases, the quantity of labor supplied responds to the wage(the price of labor). Thus, the decisions of these workers are distorted when their labor earnings are taxed. Labor taxes encourage workers to work fewer hours, second earners to stay at home, the elderly to retire early, and the unscrupulous to enter the underground economy.
These two views of labor taxation persist to this day. Indeed, whenever you see two political candidates debating whether the government should provide more services or reduce the tax burden, keep in mind that part of the disagreement may rest on different views about the elasticity of labor supply and the deadweight loss of taxation.

title: # Henry George and the Land Tax
Is there an ideal tax? Henry George, the nineteenth-century American economist and social philosopher, thought so. In his 1879 book *Progress and Poverty*, George argued that the government should raise all its revenue from a tax on land. This "single tax" was,he claimed,both equitable and efficient. George's ideas won him a large political following,
